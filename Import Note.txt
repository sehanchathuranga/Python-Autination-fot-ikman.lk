Import note,

1). Navigate to ikman.lk
2). Searches for the motorcycle model "ct100"
3). captures the required information from the first 50 results, but there are only 26 results.

Then, for the first and second points, try to do it. But I do not know why this method is used. I used to go to Chrome and search for an item manual, get that URL, and then work on it.
